## **Introduction**

This document is the developer guide for CanoE-COACH, a training scheduling app for secondary school canoeing coaches.

This developer guide serves to provide developers with an understanding on how CanoE-COACH is designed.

## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_  at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit PlantUML diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/canoe/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/canoe/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/canoe/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel
`,  `TrainingListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/canoe/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/canoe/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `CanoeCoachParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/canoe/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the CanoeCoach data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>`  and `ObservableList<Training>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
 the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP
) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `CanoeCoach`, which `Student` references. This allows `CanoeCoach` to
 only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` object. At the same time, each student contains references to 5 day objects, each storing the dismissal time of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. <br>

</div>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/canoe/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the CanoeCoach data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.canoe.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### AnyMatchPredicateList / AllMatchPredicateList

### AnyMatchPredicateList

### Implementation

The `AnyMatchPredicateList` class implements the `Predicate` interface provided by the Java util library.

The `AnyMatchPredicateList` class has only one field which is a list of predicates passed to it when the constructor is called.

The list of predicates can consist of any predicate relating to a field inside of the `Student` class.

The `AnyMatchPredicateList` class has a `AnyMatchPredicateList#test()` method with a `Student` object as a parameter. This method will return true if the passed `Student` matches any of the predicates in the predicate list.

The usage of the `AnyMatchPredicateList` class is for filtering of the `Student` `ObservableList` inside of the `Model` interface.

Below is a sequence diagram of the execution of `CommonTimeCommand` which uses the `AnyMatchPredicateList` class to filter students:

![CommonTimeCommandSequenceDiagram](images/CommonTimeCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

In the diagram above, the `CommonTimeCommandParser` will parse the arguments and add any necessary `Predicates` into the `AnyMatchPredicateList` which is passed as an argument during the creation of the `CommonTimeCommand`.

This `AnyMatchPredicateList` is then used to filter the student list in the method `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` which takes in the predicate list as an argument.

### AllMatchPredicateList

The `AllMatchPredicateList` has a similar implementation to the `AnyMatchPredicateList`. The only difference is that the `AllMatchPredicateList#test()` method returns true only if the passed `Student` matches **ALL** of the predicates in the predicate list.

The following class diagram shows the relationship between AnyMatchPredicateList and AllMatchPredicateList and the fields inside of the Student class:

![PredicateListClassDiagram](images/PredicateListClassDiagram.png)

### Training Class

#### Implementation

The Training Class represents a Training Session that Students can attend.

Training Class has 2 fields, a LocalDateTime that stores the date and time of the Training Session, and a HashSet of Students that stores the unique Students attending the Training Session.

A Training Session is initialised with no Students in the HashSet by default.

The following shows the relationship between Student, Training and Attendance.

![Relationship of Attend, Training, Student](images/TrainingStudentAttendRS.png)

### Find-training feature

#### Implementation

The find-training mechanism extends `Command` with the ability to view all training history (past and present) of a single student. This command is supported by methods in the `Model` interface, namely `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()`,  and`Model#updateFilteredTrainingList()`.

![TrainingMatchesIdPredicateDiagram](images/TrainingMatchesIdPredicateDiagram.png)

This command is supported by `TrainingMatchesIdPredicate#test()`, which assists to check if a particular student ID is present in a particular training. 

![TrainingMatchesDateTimePredicateDiagram](images/TrainingMatchesDateTimePredicateDiagram.png)

This command is supported by `TrainingMatchesDateTimePredicate#test()`, which assists to check if a particular date-time matches that of a particular training's date-time. 

![IdMatchesPredicateDiagram](images/IdMatchesPredicateDiagram.png)

This command is supported by `IdMatchesPredicate#test()`, which assists to check if a particular Id matches that of a particular student's Id. 

![DateTimeMatchesPredicateDiagram](images/DateTimeMatchesPredicateDiagram.png)

Lastly, this command is supported by `DateTimeMatchesPredicate#test()`, which assists to check if a particular student's training schedules contain a training with a particular date-time. 

![FindTrainingPredicatesDiagram](images/FindTrainingPredicatesDiagram.png)

From the diagram above, all four of the above-mentioned predicates implements the Predicate interface. Depending on input parameters specified, different predicates are used as input arguments to the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` and `Model#updateFilteredTrainingList()` methods.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find-training mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. As the student panel only displays the most recent 3 upcoming trainings scheduled, the user executes `find-training id/5` command to view all the trainings of the uniquely identified 5th student in the CanoeCoach.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` or `Model#updateFilteredTrainingList()`, so the GUI state will not be changed or altered.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find-training` operation works:

![FindTrainingSequenceDiagram](images/FindTrainingSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindTrainingCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![FindTrainingActivityDiagram](images/FindTrainingActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How find-training executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Filters both the student and training lists based on the student index.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Double panel filter required

* **Alternative 2:** Filters only the student list and retrieve all trainings of the student from student list to display.
  * Pros: Only one panel filter required
  * Cons: Training objects are not stored directly within the student class, hence it might be difficult to retrieve trainings

### Add Student to Training feature

#### Implementation

The mechanism to add Students to Training Sessions works by taking in the user inputs of the Index of the Training Session to be edited,
as well as the Ids of the Students to be added, and adds the corresponding Students to the Training Session at the
specified index.

It extends `Command` with the overwritten `AddStudentToTrainingCommand#execute()` method
that checks a number of fields as follows before adding the Student to the Training Session:

- Whether the student can attend the Training using `Student#isAvalable(LocalDateTime dateTime)`
- Whether the student is already in the Training Session using `AddStudentToTrainingCommand#uniqueChecker(Student student)`

After all the checks have passed, the Student is then added to the Training Session and the model updated using `Model#setStudent(Student targetStudent, Student editedStudent)`,
and `Model#setTraining(Training targetTraining, Training editedTraining)`.

If any of the Students fail any of the checks, the command is discarded and the corresponding `CommandException`
will be thrown to notify the user of the error.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the AddStudentToTrainingCommand behaves.

Step 1. The user launches the application with one training session and 1 student with Id "1".

Step 2. The user inputs `ts-add 1 id/1` and hits enter.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `ts-add` operation works:

![AddStudentToTrainingSequenceDiagram](images/AddStudentToTrainingSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` or `Model#updateFilteredTrainingList()`, so the GUI state will not be changed or altered.

</div>

The activity diagram below shows what happens when a new `ts-add` command is executed:

![AddStudentToTrainingActivityDiagram](images/AddStudentToTrainingActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()` or `Model#updateFilteredTrainingList()`, so the GUI state will not be changed or altered.

</div>

#### Design Consideration:

#### Aspect: How Student is added to the Training Session

* **Alternative 1:** Create a key-value pair with Student ID as the key and Student object as the value.
    * Pros : Eliminates the possibility of repeat students as each Student object only corresponds to one Student ID.
    * Cons : Need to create a new Class containing the key-value pair and refactor both Training and Student.
            Also makes the code base more complicated.

* **Alternative 2: (current choice)** Within the AddStudentToTrainingCommand implement checks to make sure that
the student to be added is not a duplicate.
    * Pros : This  is easier to implement than the key-value pair approach.
    * Cons : Checks have to be done carefully in during Command execution to prevent duplicates or bugs.

### Add all students to training feature

#### Implementation

The feature to add all students to a training extends `Command` which allows users to add all valid students, displayed on the current student list,
to a specified training. This command is supported by methods in the `Model` interface, namely `Model#getFilteredStudentList()` and `Model#getFilteredTrainingList()`.

A student is valid if they can make it for the training and if they are not already in that training. Specifically,
* The student's dismissal time is equal to or before the training's start time for the particular date
* The student does not already have a training scheduled at that date time
* The training does not already have the student added

These checks in the command are supported by `Student#isAvailableAtDateTime`, `Student#hasTrainingAtDateTime`, and `Training#hasStudent`.
Students who are added to the training will have their training schedule updated to reflect this addition, and the training will also
be updated to contain the added student.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command's mechanism behaves at each step.
It is assumed that there is an existing training and students in their respective lists.

Step 1. The user launches the application, then the user executes `ts-addall 1` to add all students, currently displayed, to the training at index 1.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, nothing will be changed or altered.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the `ts-addall` operation works:

![AddAllStudentToTrainingSequenceDiagram](images/AddAllStudentToTrainingSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddAllStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the command:

![AddAllStudentToTrainingActivityDiagram](images/AddAllStudentToTrainingActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

#### Aspect: How the command handles a list containing valid and invalid students

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Ignore invalid students and only add valid students.
  * Pros: Friendlier to the user since the feature is for convenient mass adding of students.
  * Cons: Hard to implement because of different handling behaviour of different students.

* **Alternative 2:** Returns failed command execution if there are invalid students in the list.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, either all students can be added or no student will be added.
  * Cons: More restrictive and less user-friendly, use case will be almost similar to `ts-add` command.

### Attendance class

#### Implementation

The Attendance class represents a Student attending a Training. A list of Attendance is stored in the Student, and represents all the trainings that the Student would be attending.

The Attendance class is initialised with the LocalDateTime of a Training. Currently, it also stores information about whether the Student had attended the Training or not. By default, the Attendance is marked as unattended.

The following shows the relationship between Student, Training and Attendance.

![Relationship of Attend, Training, Student](images/TrainingStudentAttendRS.png)


#### Design considerations:
#### Aspect: How to keep track of which trainings that a Student is attending

*  **Alternative 1:** Store a list of trainings that the Student is attending in the Student.
	* Pros: Easier implementation in the short run.
	* Cons: This causes cyclic-dependency and is undesirable.

* **Alternative 2 (Previous iteration):** Store a list of LocalDateTime in the Student, each representing the time of a Training that the Student is attending.
	* Pros: Relatively easy to implement
	* Cons: It is difficult to extend features related to Attendance, and it is inflexible.

* **Alternative 3:** Store a list of Attendances in a wrapper class, that could have, for example, a Hashmap that maps a Student to the list of Attendances.
	* Pros: This will lead to higher cohesion and low coupling, and increases the maintainability of the code.
	* Cons: It is more complex to implement. Much harder to display the attendance of a Student in the StudentCard in this current iteration.

* **Alternative 4 (Current iteration):**  Store a list of Attendance in the Student.
	* Pros: Difficulty of implementation is lower than Alternative 3. Able to support other functions easily compared to Alternative 2.
	* Cons: Potentially prone to bugs.

### Mark-attendance feature

#### Implementation

The mark-attendance mechanism extends `Command` with the ability to mark a student as having attended a particular training session.

This feature makes use of the `Attend` class which each student keeps track of. As stated above, by default an `Attend` object is constructed with `hasAttended = false`. This command sets `hasAttended` to equal to `true`.

The mark-attendance command takes in a `Training` index and multiple `Student` ids as input. Any error in the input format will result in the whole command being discarded and the state of the canoe coach book will remain unchanged.
A list of possible input errors are listed below:
- `Training` index is out of range -> `Training` cannot be found
- `Student` index is out of range -> `Student` cannot be found
- Empty parameters. i.e. `Training` index and/or `Student` ids not input
- `Student` does not have specified `Training` as part of its schedule

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()`, so the GUI state will not be changed or altered.

</div>

The following shows the sequence flow for the `mark-attendance` command:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#updateFilteredStudentList()`, so the GUI state will not be changed or altered.

</div>

The following activity diagram shows the flow of events when a user executes a `mark-attendance` command:

![MarkAttendanceActivityDiagram](images/MarkAttendanceActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How a student's attendance is tracked

* **Alternative 1:** Create a variable in training with a key-value pair to track student and student's attendance.
  * Pros: Each student is paired with it's own attendance upon addition to the training.
  * Cons: A key-value pair variable makes the code more complicated than it has to be.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use of a class to store attendance of a student for a scheduled training.
  * Pros: A class is easier to maintain and access than a key-value pair. Code is simpler.
  * Cons: A new class has to be created and refactoring of the code base has to be done.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCanoeCoach`. It extends `CanoeCoach` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `canoeCoachStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCanoeCoach#commit()` — Saves the current CanoeCoach state in its history.
* `VersionedCanoeCoach#undo()` — Restores the previous CanoeCoach state from its history.
* `VersionedCanoeCoach#redo()` — Restores a previously undone CanoeCoach state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCanoeCoach()`, `Model#undoCanoeCoach()` and `Model#redoCanoeCoach()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCanoeCoach` will be initialized with the initial CanoeCoach state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single CanoeCoach state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the CanoeCoach. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCanoeCoach()`, causing the modified state of the CanoeCoach after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `canoeCoachStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted CanoeCoach state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCanoeCoach()`, causing another modified CanoeCoach state to be saved into the `canoeCoachStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCanoeCoach()`, so the CanoeCoach state will not be saved into the `canoeCoachStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCanoeCoach()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous CanoeCoach state, and restores the CanoeCoach to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial CanoeCoach state, then there are no previous CanoeCoach states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCanoeCoach()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoCanoeCoach()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the CanoeCoach to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `canoeCoachStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest CanoeCoach state, then there are no undone CanoeCoach states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCanoeCoach()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the CanoeCoach, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCanoeCoach()`, `Model#undoCanoeCoach()` or `Model#redoCanoeCoach()`. Thus, the `canoeCoachStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCanoeCoach()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `canoeCoachStateList`, all CanoeCoach states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire CanoeCoach.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.
